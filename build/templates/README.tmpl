INSTALLATION
This distribution of tinytlf is distributed with the binary SWC file (@releasename@.swc).
The SWC file should be enough to get started. Simply drop it in your projects libs folder (or wherever you keep 
external libraries) and you will have access to the fully functioning framework. 

BUILDING
In addition to the SWC file in this distribution package, the tinytlf v@ttlfversion@ source code
is also provided.

If you would prefer to build from the source, it is highly recommended that you download the ttlf
project in its entirety. This project contains all of the required libraries and ANT build scripts to generate SWC
files of the framework. This project can be found at: @ttlfprojectlink@

USAGE
Good luck.
